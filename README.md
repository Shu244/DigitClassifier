# DigitClassifier
Neural network for classifying handwritten digits. Written from scratch using C++; No machine learning libraries were used. 

The goal of this project is to practice using the fundamental ideas of neural networks. This includes backpropagation, sigmoid functions, matrice manipulation, normalizing data inputs, setting initial weights and biases, good training pratices (such as setting hyperparameters), and developing an intuitive understanding of the system.
